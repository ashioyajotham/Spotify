## My journey to build a music recommender system


1) [Spotify] # Spotify Analytics Dashboard

AIM
* To create an analytics dashboard to visualize my Spotify usage

Requirements
  * Spotify Developer Account
  * Tableau
  * Jupyter Notebooks

* I Gathered my Spotify data by logging into `Spotify` > `Privacy` then click download data (Usually you fill a request and it takes up to 30 days)
* I cleaned the data by removing the duplicates and filling missing values
* Create a Spotify developer account or if you have one already, create an application and obtain the `key` and `access` endpoints. We will need them for the `BASE_URL`
* Create a Tableau dashboard with the finished dataa and visualize how you want.

Here's my Tableau dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashioyajotham/viz/spotify-viz/Dashboard1


*************** It's a work in progress. I plan to automate the dashboard to release a monthly report and also implement a recommender system *******************
